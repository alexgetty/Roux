# Stale Update Overwrites — MOVED TO ROADMAP

> **Status:** Moved to roadmap. Requires design work, not a quick fix.

See [[Stale Update Prevention]] for full analysis and research needs.

## Original Incident

Agent overwrote user's manual file edits by using cached content from earlier in conversation instead of re-reading current state.
