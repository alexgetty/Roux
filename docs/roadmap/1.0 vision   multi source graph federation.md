# Multi-Source Graph Federation

Graph boundaries defined by configuration, not filesystem. Multiple repos, folders, or sources unified into a single knowledge space.

## Core Concept

Physical separation ≠ logical separation. A monorepo and its companion docs repo are one knowledge space. A codebase and its external research corpus share context.

## Requirements

- Configuration-based source definition
- Source-aware node IDs (namespacing)
- Cross-source linking and traversal
- Independent sync/refresh per source
- Unified query interface across all sources

## Enables

- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#DevMemory]] - docs and code in same graph
- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#Research Corpus Manager]] - multiple paper sources unified
- Team workflows with shared + private graph segments
