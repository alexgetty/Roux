# Structural Traversal

Graph primitives: nodes, edges, paths. The mechanical bones that semantic search rides on.

## Core Concept

A graph is only useful if you can walk it. Traversal is the foundation for context discovery, relationship mapping, and knowledge navigation.

## Requirements

- Neighbor discovery (in/out/both directions)
- Path finding (shortest path between nodes)
- Hub detection (most connected nodes)
- Depth-limited traversal
- Filtered traversal (by tags, properties, node type)
- Efficient for large graphs

## Current State

Basic traversal implemented: get_neighbors, find_path, get_hubs. Works for current scale.

## Enables

- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#CodeGraph]] - call graph traversal
- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#ContextEngine]] - walking from changed file to related context
- Knowledge mapping and visualization
