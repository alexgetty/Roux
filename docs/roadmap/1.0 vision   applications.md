# Applications Built on Roux

These are products/tools that consume the GPI. First-party, third-party, plugins, or standalone apps. Roux is the engine, not the car.

---

## CodeGraph

AST-level parsing of codebases. Functions, classes, variables as nodes. Call graphs, type dependencies as edges. Semantic search across code structure. Language-specific parsers (Tree-sitter based).

**Enables:** "Show me every function that handles X" ranked by semantic similarity to what you're building. Pattern discovery. Consistency enforcement.

---

## ContextEngine

File-change hooks that trigger graph traversal. Assembles context bundles for agents: code examples, docs, decisions, recent edits, pattern rules. Agent-framework agnostic injection layer.

**Enables:** Automated context curation. Agents receive exactly what they need without manual prompt engineering.

---

## DevMemory

The full "codebase that remembers" experience. CodeGraph + ContextEngine + docs + decisions + project management. The integrated workflow for agentic software development.

**Thesis:** Surgical code changes + deep curated context = dramatically better agentic output.

---

## Auto-Researcher

Autonomous bots that build, maintain, and curate knowledge graphs for specific domains or open questions. Proactive self-guided research and knowledge formation. The graph grows continuously, not just when queried.

**Enables:** Knowledge accumulation while you sleep. Domain expertise that compounds over time. Open questions in science tracked and updated automatically.

---

## Personal Knowledge Base

Obsidian-style PKM backed by Roux. Notes, research, connections. Human-first but AI-augmentable.

**Enables:** Personal knowledge that grows richer through use. Semantic search across your own thinking.

---

## Research Corpus Manager

Academic/research use case. Papers, annotations, citations as graph. Semantic discovery across literature.

**Enables:** "Find papers related to X" across your entire research corpus. Citation graph traversal. Gap identification.

---

## Documentation System

Living docs that stay connected to what they document. Auto-detection of staleness via code graph links.

**Enables:** Docs that know when they're out of date. Automatic "this section may need review" based on linked code changes.
