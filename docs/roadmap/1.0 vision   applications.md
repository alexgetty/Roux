# Applications Built on Roux

These are products/tools that consume the GPI. First-party, third-party, plugins, or standalone apps. Roux is the engine, not the car.

---

## Developer Tools

### CodeGraph
AST-level parsing of codebases. Functions, classes, variables as nodes. Call graphs, type dependencies as edges. Semantic search across code structure. Language-specific parsers (Tree-sitter based).

**Enables:** "Show me every function that handles X" ranked by semantic similarity. Pattern discovery. Consistency enforcement.

### ContextEngine
File-change hooks that trigger graph traversal. Assembles context bundles for agents: code examples, docs, decisions, recent edits, pattern rules. Agent-framework agnostic injection layer.

**Enables:** Automated context curation. Agents receive exactly what they need without manual prompt engineering.

### DevMemory
The full "codebase that remembers" experience. CodeGraph + ContextEngine + docs + decisions + project management. The integrated workflow for agentic software development.

**Thesis:** Surgical code changes + deep curated context = dramatically better agentic output.

### IDE Context Extension
Human-facing ContextEngine. Open a file → sidebar populates with relevant docs, decisions, patterns. The human equivalent of context injection.

**Enables:** Ambient context. Onboarding becomes "start working, knowledge appears."

## Knowledge Management

### Personal Knowledge Base
Obsidian-style PKM backed by Roux. Notes, research, connections. Human-first but AI-augmentable.

**Enables:** Personal knowledge that grows richer through use. Semantic search across your own thinking.

### Decision Journal
Structured tracking of decisions over time. What we decided, considered, rejected, and why. Queryable history.

**Enables:** Institutional memory. Avoid re-litigating. Historical context.

See: [[1.0 Vision - Decision Journal]]

### Documentation System
Living docs connected to what they document. Auto-detection of staleness via code graph links.

**Enables:** Docs that know when they're out of date.

## Research & Intelligence

### Auto-Researcher
Autonomous bots that build, maintain, and curate knowledge graphs for specific domains or open questions. Proactive self-guided research.

**Enables:** Knowledge accumulation while you sleep. Domain expertise that compounds.

### Research Corpus Manager
Academic/research use case. Papers, annotations, citations as graph. Semantic discovery across literature.

**Enables:** "Find papers related to X" across your corpus. Citation graph traversal.

### Competitive Intelligence Tracker
Auto-Researcher focused on competitors. Monitors, updates, surfaces changes.

**Enables:** Stay informed without manual research. Early warning on competitive moves.

See: [[1.0 Vision - Competitive Intelligence Tracker]]

## Communication & Workflow

### Conversation Graph
Meetings, chat, and support threads as knowledge nodes. Extract decisions, action items, questions.

**Enables:** "Show me the Slack threads where we debated X." Decisions traced to conversations.

See: [[1.0 Vision - Conversation Graph]]

### Changelog Generator
Semantic changelogs from mutation traces. Not git commits - knowledge-level changes.

**Enables:** Stakeholder updates without manual writing. Pattern detection.
