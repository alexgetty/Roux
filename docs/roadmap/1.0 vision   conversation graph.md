# Conversation Graph

Meetings, chat, and support threads as knowledge nodes.

## Core Concept

Conversations are knowledge trapped in silos - Slack, Zoom transcripts, support tickets, email threads. Pull them into the graph, link them to the decisions and code they influenced.

## Content Types

- **Meeting transcripts**: Zoom, Teams, Google Meet
- **Chat threads**: Slack, Discord, Teams
- **Support tickets**: Zendesk, Intercom, GitHub Issues
- **Email threads**: Gmail, Outlook

## Processing Pipeline

1. Ingest raw conversation
2. Chunk into meaningful segments
3. Extract: decisions made, action items, questions raised
4. Create nodes for conversation + extracted items
5. Link to related existing nodes (semantic + explicit mentions)

## Extracted Node Types

- **Decision**: Auto-detected from conversation → Decision Journal
- **Action Item**: Task identified → could link to issue tracker
- **Question**: Open question raised → could seed research
- **Reference**: Existing node mentioned → bidirectional link

## The Full Loop (Future)

Meeting → transcript → decision detected → doc created → related docs updated → tickets proposed → code written → tested → deployed

Roux is the connective tissue. Each step knows about every other step.

## Enables

- "Show me the Slack threads where we debated X"
- Meeting notes linked to outcomes
- No more "I think we discussed this somewhere"
- Decisions traced back to the conversation that made them
