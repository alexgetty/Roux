# Pluggable Providers

Add capability without changing the GPI contract.

## Core Concept

GraphCore is the orchestration hub with zero functionality itself - delegates to pluggable providers. Swap storage, embeddings, LLMs without rewriting application code.

## Provider Types

- **StoreProvider** (required): Where nodes live. DocStore, future SQLite, Neo4j, etc.
- **EmbeddingProvider** (optional): Vector generation. OpenAI, local models, etc.
- **LLMProvider** (optional): Co-authoring, summarization, inference.
- **Future**: Cache, sync, notification providers.

## Requirements

- Clean provider interfaces
- Runtime capability detection
- Graceful degradation when optional providers missing
- Provider-specific configuration
- Hot-swappable where feasible

## Current State

Provider architecture implemented. DocStore and OpenAI embedding working. LLM provider in progress.

## Enables

- Deploy anywhere (local, cloud, air-gapped)
- Cost optimization (swap embedding providers)
- Future storage backends without API changes
