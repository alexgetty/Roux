# Semantic Layer

Embeddings across all content. Semantic search as a first-class primitive.

## Core Concept

Every node has a vector representation. Search by meaning, not just keywords. The graph understands similarity and relatedness.

## Requirements

- Configurable embedding providers
- Model-agnostic storage (swap providers without full reindex)
- Incremental embedding on content change
- Similarity thresholds and ranking
- Batch embedding for initial indexing
- Model mismatch detection and warnings

## Current State

Already implemented via EmbeddingProvider. Model mismatch detection added. Incremental updates working.

## Enables

- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#ContextEngine]] - semantic relevance for context assembly
- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#Auto-Researcher]] - discovery across domains
- "Find related" across entire knowledge space
