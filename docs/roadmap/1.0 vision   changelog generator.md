# Changelog Generator

Semantic changelogs from mutation traces.

## Core Concept

If we have mutation tracing, we can generate "what changed and why" automatically. Not git commits (too granular, wrong abstraction). Semantic changes at the knowledge level.

## Output Examples

```
## Week of Jan 27, 2025

### Added
- Three new recipes: Bulgogi, Kimchi Jjigae, Japchae
- Auth architecture decision doc

### Updated  
- API patterns doc: deprecated v1 endpoint style
- Deployment guide: added Kubernetes section

### Decisions Made
- Chose JWT over sessions for auth (see: Decision #42)
- Deprecated REST in favor of GraphQL for new endpoints

### Emerging Themes
- Increased focus on Korean cuisine
- Infrastructure modernization in progress
```

## How It Works

1. Query mutation trace for time period
2. Group by operation type and node type
3. Summarize with LLM (optional - can be mechanical)
4. Detect patterns and themes across changes
5. Output as markdown, HTML, or structured data

## Levels of Detail

- **Summary**: High-level themes
- **Detailed**: Every node change
- **Filtered**: Only certain node types or tags

## Enables

- Stakeholder updates without manual writing
- Historical record of knowledge evolution
- Pattern detection ("we've been focused on X lately")
- Integration with external changelog systems
