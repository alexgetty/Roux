# Roux 1.0 Vision

The complete picture of where we're headed.

## Core Identity

Roux is a **Graph Programming Interface (GPI)** - a substrate for structured knowledge that grows richer over time. Consumer-agnostic: humans, AI agents, and applications all interact through the same primitives.

**Key Insight:** Git-compatible = Roux-compatible. Any text file, any repo, version-controlled and safe.

## Infrastructure

The primitives that make everything else possible.

| Component | Status | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| [[1.0 Vision - Multi-Source Graph Federation]] | Planned | High |
| [[1.0 Vision - Universal Text Node Support]] | Partial | High |
| [[1.0 Vision - Semantic Layer]] | Implemented | - |
| [[1.0 Vision - Structural Traversal]] | Implemented | - |
| [[1.0 Vision - Mutation Tracing]] | Planned | Medium |
| [[1.0 Vision - Pluggable Providers]] | Implemented | - |
| [[1.0 Vision - Hook System]] | Planned | High |
| [[1.0 Vision - Content-Agnostic Linking]] | Partial | Medium |
| [[1.0 Vision - Query Composition]] | Planned | High |
| [[1.0 Vision - Ontology System]] | Planned | High (First Plugin) |

## Applications

Products and tools built on the GPI.

See: [[1.0 Vision - Applications]]

**Developer Tools:** CodeGraph, ContextEngine, DevMemory, IDE Extension
**Knowledge Management:** PKM, Decision Journal, Documentation System  
**Research & Intelligence:** Auto-Researcher, Research Corpus, Competitive Intel
**Communication & Workflow:** Conversation Graph, Changelog Generator

## First Plugin: Schema.org Integration

Stress-testing the plugin architecture with the Ontology System.

See: [[Plugin - Schema.org Validator]] (to be created)

## Design Principles

1. **Substrate, not application** - Roux enables, apps consume
2. **Compound knowledge** - The graph grows richer through use
3. **Consumer-agnostic** - Humans, agents, apps use same primitives
4. **Standards-based** - schema.org, git, markdown - no lock-in
5. **Graceful degradation** - Features fail gracefully, never crash
