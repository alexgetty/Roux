# Roux 1.0 Vision

The complete picture of where we're headed.

## Core Identity

Roux is a **Graph Programming Interface (GPI)** - a substrate for structured knowledge that grows richer over time. Consumer-agnostic: humans, AI agents, and applications all interact through the same primitives.

**Key Insight:** Git-compatible = Roux-compatible. Any text file, any repo, version-controlled and safe.

## Node Schema

The fundamental data structure. See [[1.0 Vision - Node Schema]].

```typescript
interface Node {
  // Core fields (reserved)
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  tags: string[];
  links: Link[];
  type?: string;
  
  // Context namespaces (everything else)
  [context: string]: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

**Key decisions:**
- No `properties` bucket, no `plugins` bucket - just core + namespaced contexts
- Context = coherent subgraph (graph thinking, not filesystem thinking)
- Context names configurable per scope or derived dynamically
- Plugins use their ID as namespace; user data uses configured context name

## Infrastructure

The primitives that make everything else possible.

Products and tools built on the GPI.

See: [[1.0 Vision - Applications]]

**Developer Tools:** CodeGraph, ContextEngine, DevMemory, IDE Extension
**Knowledge Management:** PKM, Decision Journal, Documentation System  
**Research & Intelligence:** Auto-Researcher, Research Corpus, Competitive Intel

## First Plugin: Schema.org Validator

Stress-testing the plugin architecture. Implements the Ontology System.

See: [[Plugin - Schema.org Validator]]

**Key features:**
- Behind-the-scenes validation (not user-facing namespace)
- Proactive metadata scaffolding for recognized types
- Type inference via embeddings
- Hooks into DocStore file watcher pipeline

## Design Principles

1. **Substrate, not application** - Roux enables, apps consume
2. **Compound knowledge** - The graph grows richer through use
3. **Consumer-agnostic** - Humans, agents, apps use same primitives
4. **Standards-based** - schema.org, git, markdown - no lock-in
5. **Graceful degradation** - Features fail gracefully, never crash
6. **Context over workspace** - Graph thinking, not filesystem thinking
