# Decision Journal

Dedicated pattern for tracking decisions over time.

## Core Concept

Not just "decisions exist in the graph" but a structured approach. What we decided, what we considered, what we rejected, why. Queryable history of choices.

## Decision Node Schema

Using ontology system with custom type extending schema.org/ChooseAction:

- **context**: What prompted this decision
- **options**: What we considered (list)
- **outcome**: What we chose
- **rationale**: Why we chose it
- **rejected**: What we didn't choose and why
- **date**: When decided
- **participants**: Who was involved
- **status**: Active, superseded, revisiting

## Queries Enabled

- "Show me every time we decided against caching"
- "What decisions did we make about auth?"
- "Decisions from Q3 that are now superseded"
- "Decisions where we rejected option X"

## Integration Points

- Links to code that implements the decision
- Links to docs that explain the decision
- Links to conversations where it was discussed
- Supersedes/superseded-by relationships

## Enables

- Institutional memory
- Avoid re-litigating settled decisions
- Understand historical context
- Onboarding ("here's why we do it this way")
