# Query Composition

Compose search, traversal, and filter primitives into complex queries.

## Core Concept

Applications need more than atomic operations. "Find nodes tagged X, within 2 hops of Y, modified in the last week, ranked by semantic similarity to Z." One query, not five API calls stitched together.

## Requirements

- Chainable query builder API
- Combine semantic search + structural traversal + filters
- Temporal filters (modified since, created before)
- Tag/property filters
- Proximity constraints (within N hops of node X)
- Result ranking (semantic similarity, recency, centrality)
- Optional: DSL for power users / saved queries

## Open Questions

- Builder API vs DSL vs both?
- How does this compose with ontology-typed queries?
- Performance implications of complex queries on large graphs

## Enables

- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#ContextEngine]] - complex relevance queries
- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#Auto-Researcher]] - sophisticated discovery
- Power-user workflows
- Saved/named queries for repeated patterns
