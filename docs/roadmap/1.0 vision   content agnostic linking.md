# Content-Agnostic Linking

Multiple link syntaxes. Links resolved at graph level, not file level.

## Core Concept

Links are the edges of the graph. They shouldn't be tied to one syntax or one file type. Wikilinks in markdown, imports in code, references in configs - all become graph edges.

## Requirements

- Pluggable link extractors per content type
- Wikilink syntax for markdown (current)
- Import/require detection for code files
- Explicit edge API for programmatic linking
- Cross-source linking (link from repo A to repo B)
- Broken link detection and reporting

## Link Types

- **Implicit**: Extracted from content (wikilinks, imports)
- **Explicit**: Created via API
- **Typed**: Edges with relationship semantics (implements, tests, documents)

## Enables

- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#CodeGraph]] - import graph as edges
- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#Documentation System]] - docs linked to code they describe
- Cross-repo knowledge connections
- Relationship-aware traversal
