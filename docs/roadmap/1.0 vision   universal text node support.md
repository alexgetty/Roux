# Universal Text Node Support

Any text file is a node. Markdown, code, config, prose - the GPI doesn't discriminate by extension.

## Core Concept

Git-compatible = Roux-compatible. If it's text and version-controlled, it can be a node. The graph understands content, not file formats.

## Requirements

- Extension-agnostic node creation
- Pluggable content extractors per file type
- Frontmatter/metadata extraction where applicable
- Raw content fallback for unknown types
- Configurable include/exclude patterns

## Enables

- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#CodeGraph]] - code files as first-class nodes
- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#DevMemory]] - entire repo as knowledge graph
- Config files, specs, any text artifact in the graph
