# Mutation Tracing

Every write operation captured. Audit and replay built into the core.

## Core Concept

The graph remembers how it grew. Every mutation is a trace - who changed what, when, and in what context. Multi-actor provenance: human creates, AI suggests, human accepts, application logs.

## Requirements

- Actor identification (human, agent ID, application)
- Timestamp on all mutations
- Operation type (create, update, delete, link)
- Causality chain (what triggered this mutation)
- Queryable mutation history
- Opt-in replay capability

## Enables

- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#DevMemory]] - "who changed this and why"
- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#Auto-Researcher]] - tracking how knowledge evolved
- Audit trails for regulated environments
- Undo/replay for recovery
- Understanding emergent knowledge accumulation
