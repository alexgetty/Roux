# IDE Context Extension

Human-facing ContextEngine. Surfaces relevant knowledge when you open a file.

## Core Concept

The human equivalent of context-injecting an agent. Open a file → sidebar populates with relevant docs, decisions, patterns, recent changes. No manual search. The system knows what you're working on and gives you what you need.

## How It Works

1. File opened in IDE
2. Extension queries Roux graph (file as seed node)
3. Traversal + semantic search finds related context
4. Sidebar displays: relevant docs, linked decisions, similar code patterns, recent changes to this area
5. Natural language query box for follow-up questions

## Requirements

- VSCode extension (primary target)
- Roux MCP or local API connection
- Configurable relevance tuning
- Collapsible sections by context type
- Click-through to source nodes
- Query box with streaming responses

## User Experience

As long as the user can articulate their goal, the system helps. Context is ambient, not searched for. Onboarding becomes "start working, knowledge appears."

## Enables

- Reduced context-switching
- Faster ramp-up on unfamiliar code
- Decisions visible where they matter
- Pattern consistency (see examples while coding)

## Dependencies

- [[1.0 Vision - Hook System]] - file change detection
- [[1.0 Vision - Query Composition]] - complex relevance queries
- [[1.0 Vision - Semantic Layer]] - similarity ranking
