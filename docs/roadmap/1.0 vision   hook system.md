# Hook System

Event-driven triggers on graph operations. The plumbing that reactive applications build on.

## Core Concept

Applications need to respond to graph changes. File watchers, mutation triggers, pre/post hooks. The infrastructure that enables ContextEngine and similar reactive patterns.

## Requirements

- File change detection (watch mode)
- Pre-mutation hooks (validate, transform, reject)
- Post-mutation hooks (notify, trigger, cascade)
- Configurable hook registration
- Async hook execution
- Hook failure handling (continue vs abort)

## Hook Types

- **File hooks**: External file changes detected
- **Graph hooks**: Node/edge mutations
- **Query hooks**: Search and traversal events
- **Lifecycle hooks**: Startup, shutdown, sync

## Enables

- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#ContextEngine]] - file change triggers context assembly
- [[1.0 Vision - Applications#Documentation System]] - staleness detection on linked code change
- Real-time sync and notification systems
- Validation and consistency enforcement
